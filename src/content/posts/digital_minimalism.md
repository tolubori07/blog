<p>A reflection on Cal Newport's book of the same title</p>
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold"> What is digital minimalism?</h1>
<p>Or rather let's begin by explaining <mark class="font-bold">What digital minimalism isn't.</mark> A lot of people might be tempted to think that digital minimalism is about simply using your phone less. And they are correct but only to some extent. In reality, the philosophy of digital minimalism has a lot more intricacy and elegance to it than simply using the phone less. </p>
<blockquote class=" p-[15px] rounded-lg font-italic text-left border-l-4 border-l-black"><p>"Digital Minimalism is a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and <mark class="font-bold">optimised</mark> activities that strongly support things you value, and then <mark class="font-bold">happily miss out on everything else"</mark></p><footer>-Cal Newport, <cite>Digital Minimalism</cite></footer></blockquote>
    <p>
Using this definition by the author himself, we can get an indept understanding of what kind of philosophy digital minimalism is. Essentially digital minimalism is to only use digital devices as long as they serve a purpose. A correct purpose that will positively influence your life and allow you to use your time wisely.</p>
    <p>Throughout the entire book there's a certain tone that I really enjoyed by the author when he talked about time, he spoke about it in this economical manner that allowed you to truly phathom the true value of the time we have and how much of this time we actually end up "spending" on our digital devices. He also talks about how no one really expected social media to really be athing that anyone would use so much so that it would be dubbed as an addiction. However, through multiple psychological techniques, social media companies have been able to manipulate people into spending more time falling into that rabbit hole of social media. The result? A society that is plagued with social media addicts, plagued with social crisis among the Gen z.</p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl">Some principles of Digital minimalism</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal">
        <li><strong class="underline">Digital clutter is costly</strong>:
<p>Digital minimalists must recognise that their time and attention is costly. Having too many devices, social medias etc create an overall negative cost or a loss rather than a profit from their time that can nullify the small benefits that each item provides individually.</p>
